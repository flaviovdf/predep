# predep

Predictive Dependency (using Bayesian Blocks or Hierarchical Clustering).
Code for our paper: Quantifying Predictive Dependence - A New Measure 
with Interpretation.

We provide two implementations of the code. The one used in the paper
results is on the file `predep_paper.py`. A simpler predep closer to
the pseudocode in the paper is on the file `predep.py`.
